# Welcome to my experiments

I like to try new technologies or techniques, but that always go away after I satisfy my curiosity.
This repository is an attempt at stopping that.

I will provide all the files, scripts or documents that comes out of every experiment with any technology.
It will be categorized by topics, not by language or framework.
